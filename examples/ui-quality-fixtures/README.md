# UI Quality Fixtures

Small pages used to calibrate source-backed criteria and report wording.

- `deterministic-failure.html`: operational render failure shape for "no meaningful content".
- `deterministic-risk.html`: measurable accessibility/layout risks such as low contrast and overflow.
- `heuristic-needs-review.html`: suggestive UX risks that should be review prompts instead of hard failures.

These fixtures intentionally stay framework-free so checks can isolate DOM, style, viewport, and report behavior.
